## Data Structures

### Arrays

**Basics of Arrays:**
- *JavaArrayInitialization-1:* Write a Java program to declare and initialize an array of integers, access elements using index notation, and print the contents of the array.
- *DynamicArrayImplementation-2:* Develop a Java program to implement a dynamic array that can grow or shrink as needed. Implement add, remove, and access elements at any index.

### Linked Lists

**Singly Linked Lists:**
- *SinglyLinkedListOperations-3:* Implement a Java program for a singly linked list. This should include creating nodes, inserting and deleting nodes, and traversing the list.
- *ReverseSinglyLinkedList-4:* Write a Java program to reverse a singly linked list by iterating through the list and reversing the pointers.

**Doubly Linked Lists:**
- *DoublyLinkedListOperations-5:* Develop a Java program to implement a doubly linked list. This includes creating nodes, inserting and deleting nodes, and traversing the list in both directions.
- *FindMiddleNodeDoublyLinkedList-6:* Write a Java program to find the middle node of a doubly linked list using slow and fast pointer techniques.

**Circular Linked Lists:**
- *CircularLinkedListOperations-7:* Implement a Java program for a circular linked list. This includes creating nodes, inserting and deleting nodes, and traversing the list in a circular fashion.
- *CircularQueueImplementation-8:* Write a Java program to implement a circular queue using a circular linked list. This should include enqueue, dequeue, and front operations.

## Algorithms

### Stacks and Queues

**Stacks:**
- *StackImplementation-9:* Develop a Java program to implement a stack using an array or linked list. Include push, pop, and peek operations.
- *EvaluateExpressionUsingStack-10:* Write a Java program to evaluate an expression using a stack. Handle arithmetic operators and parentheses.

**Queues:**
- *QueueImplementation-11:* Implement a Java program to create a queue using an array or linked list. Include enqueue, dequeue, and front operations.
- *BankTellerQueueSimulation-12:* Simulate a bank teller queue using a queue in Java. This should include adding customers, processing transactions, and displaying the current queue.

### Trees

**Binary Trees:**
- *BinaryTreeImplementation-13:* Write a Java program to implement a binary tree. This includes creating nodes, inserting nodes, and traversing the tree in different orders (in-order, pre-order, post-order).
- *CheckBinaryTreeType-14:* Implement a Java program to check if a given binary tree is a full binary tree, a perfect binary tree, or a complete binary tree.

**Binary Search Trees (BSTs):**
- *BSTImplementation-15:* Write a Java program to implement a BST. This includes searching for a specific element, inserting new elements, and deleting elements.
- *BalanceBSTUsingAVLRotations-16:* Develop a Java program to balance a BST using AVL rotations, including maintaining the height.
